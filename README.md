All credit going to @ChrisCourses as the developer for this project. If you would like to learn yourself about creating simple games in JavaScript I recommend his YouTube channel. 

This project is not in a 'finished' state as there are a few ideas that I have in mind to expand upon the bones of @ChrisCourses project.
